<h3>Scouting note</h3>
<p>
  Risks occur every day in life. We don't always put thought into handling these
  risks, and we don't always avoid those risks. For example Football is a
  dangerous game and the participants are told the risks and make an informed
  choice to continue.
</p>
<p>
  Scouts accept that activities are actually risky and accept that. We do
  however take steps to remove those risks if possible and if not entirely
  possible handle the risk, for example by taking a first aid kit
</p>
<p>
  All activities should be done in accordance to scouting policy. This includes
  wearing sound enclosed shoes at all times. If you are not aware of your policy
  documents search for Scout Policy NSW (or your appropriate state).
</p>

<h3>Adventurous Activities</h3>
<p>
  When you select activities that are adventurous you will be asked to select a
  category. Once you submit the application it will automatically be available
  to all leaders authorised to review that activity. Don't worry if you select
  the wrong category the reviewers can change it if they feel appropriate.
</p>
<p>
  The leader that is considered local to the area will normally review your
  application. If they need additional information they may contact you directly
  or leave a message for you to follow up.  If you are uncertain about an issue

</p>
<h3>Events or complicated assessments</h3>
<p>
  If you are doing an event it is possible to associate multiple risk
  assessments to a top level assessment. As an example Region camp has many
  bases containing many activities. The activity as a whole can be assessed
  quickly as a combined risk and each assessment is available on a list which is
  clickable to get the detailed assessment.
</p>
<p>
  Even Jamboree is supported. With a jamboree assessment, containing bases,
  containing activities. We don't recommend complicating things like this
  though.
</p>
<h3>Templating</h3>
<p>
  Once your risk assessment has been reviewed and accepted it is possible to add
  this as a template or replace as a new template. When you start a new activity
  you can then select that template to create a new assessment to allow you to
  add local risks to existing assessments.
